# CS-210

<b>Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.</b> 

The project focused on creating a clock that displays 12 hour format and 24 hour format. The interface displays adding a hour, minute or second that displays the time after user input. 

<b> What did you do particularly well? </b>

I think I did particularly well with organizing my code in this project, I was happy that I made my main() minimized and have everything work through functions.

<b>Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on? </b> 

I didn't do well with the output as the time would be a bit off, and that is error in my coding and "math". I would need to edit the expressions in the error so I could fix the clock so it properly works, whether I added another hour, minute, second more to the clock or less. 

<b>Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? What tools or resources are you adding to your support network? </b>

I think having to display the time in general was difficult because there were a lot of conditions that can happen and can affect the whole time in general, so there's a lot of if/else expressions to determine if the clock has to go back to 0, add another hour but reset the minute and sec, add a minute and reset the second to 0 and etc.

<b>What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work?</b> 

I think skills of updating certain things will help in other projects/work involving C++ as it uses functions and organizing format as well as keeping up with the organizing format of the code in general. Having to use different variables and having them work simutainously helps with the project and would help with further ones as well

<b>How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?</b>

Organizing all code in functions and keeping a main display with input helps in making the code easy to read and I'm able to edit the code easily which makes it very maintainable. It's easy to change certain code to test certain instances which helps a lot in debugging code as well.
